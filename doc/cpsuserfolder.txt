CPSUserFolder Design
====================

$Id$

Introduction
============

CPSUserFolder is a user folder designed to work in conjunction with
CPSDirectory (and therefore CPSSchemas). Directories are used to
describe what are the attributes of a user (using a schema) and where
they are stored (depending on the type of directory). This is also used
for roles and groups, so that for instance one can easily add additional
properties to groups.

Configuration
=============

When configuring a CPS User Folder, you have to specify a number of
parameters:

Users directory

  The directory that holds the users. It's recommended that it be a
  directory called 'members', as this name is assumed by CPS in several
  place.

  The id of this directory's entries will be the user ids.

Users directory: login field

  The field of the users directory that is used to find users at login
  time. It may be different that the directory's id field.

  If it is empty, the directory's id field will be used.

Users directory: roles field

  The field of the users directory that holds the roles of the user.

Users directory: groups field

  The field of the users directory that holds the groups of the user.

During authentication, the password of an entry will be checked using
the directory's API to check authenticated entries. Depending on the
directory type, this may be a comparison with an cleartext field, or (in
the case of LDAP for instance) a specific authentication against the
directory's backend.

Directories
===========

CPSUserFolder uses heavily the MetaDirectory and StackingDirectory of
CPSDirectory. These directories provide a unified view of several other
directories, and dispatch requests accordingly. They can also convert
attribute names.

The main uses of MetaDirectory in CPSUserFolder are:

- storing some attributes of an entry in one directory (ex: LDAP for
  main corporate user information) and others attributes in another
  directory (ex: ZODB for zope-specific information like
  'last_login_time'),

- renaming fields (ex: the 'email' field of the directory 'members'
  actually comes from the 'mail' field of the directory 'members_ldap'),

The main use of StackingDirectory in CPSUserFolder is:

- having some users stored in one directory and others in another
  directory (ex: aggregation of two LDAP branche),

- providing a different view on a directory (ex: LDAP, whose id field is
  the dn, seen as standard directory whose id field is an uid).

Memberdata Tool
===============

In standard CMF, the memberdata tool exists to hold additional
information about users that cannot be stored in the user folder. With
CPSUserFolder, it's no longer necessary as a MetaDirectory can be used
to dispatch some attributes into the standard storage, and additional
attributes (login_time, last_login_time, etc.) to another storage.

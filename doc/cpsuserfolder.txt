CPSUserFolder Design
====================

$Id$

Introduction
============

CPSUserFolder is a user folder designed to work in conjunction with
CPSDirectory and therefore CPSSchemas. Directories are used to describe
what are the attributes of a user (using a schema) and where they are
stored (depending on the type of directory). This is also used for roles
and groups, so that for instance one can easily add additional
properties to groups.

Configuration
=============

When configuring a CPS User Folder, you have to specify a number of
parameters:

'users' directory
  The directory that holds user properties.

'roles' directory
  The directory that holds all the roles information.

'groups' directory
  The directory that holds groups and subgroups information.

In the 'users' directory, the id field will be used as the login name of
a user. A specific password field can be used for explicit storage of
the password in clear text or encrypted.

Directories
===========

CPSUserFolder uses heavily the MetaDirectory and StackingDirectory of
CPSDirectory. These directories provide a unified view of several other
directories, and dispatch requests accordingly. They can also convert
attribute names.

The main uses of MetaDirectory in CPSUserFolder are:

- storing some attributes in one directory (LDAP) and others attributes
  in another directory (ZODB),

- providing a different view on a directory (ex: LDAP, whose id field is
  the dn, seen as standard directory whose id field is an uid),

- renaming fields (ex: the 'email' field of the directory 'users'
  actually comes from the 'mail' field of the directory 'users_storage'),

- providing cross-references (ex: the 'groups' attribute of the 'users'
  directory is cross-referenced to the 'users' attribute of the 'groups'
  directory).

The main use of StackingDirectory in CPSUserFolder is:

- having some users stored in one directory and others in another
  directory (ex: aggregation of two LDAP branche).

Memberdata Tool
===============

In standard CMF, the memberdata tool exists to hold additional
information about users that cannot be stored in the user folder. With
CPSUserFolder, it's no longer necessary as a MetaDirectory can be used
to dispatch some attributes into the standard storage, and additional
attributes (login_time, last_login_time, etc.).
